            This project is planned to take an image and do some, hopefully, cool transformations 
            to it.  I plan to let users mess with some inputs to influence how the image is 
            transformed.
        </p>
        <p>
            This currently does not use the original image pixels when transforming the image.  It 
            also takes a while to do the transformation and it is all done on the client side, so 
            try it out with a small to medium sized file.
